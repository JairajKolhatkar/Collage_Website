      excerpt: 'Our college\'s robotics team secured first place at the National Robotics Challenge with their innovative waste management solution.',
      content: `
        <p>We are proud to announce that the VK College Robotics Team has won first place at the prestigious National Robotics Challenge held in Delhi last weekend. The team, comprising five final-year engineering students, impressed the judges with their innovative automated waste segregation system.</p>
        
        <p>The winning project, titled "EcoSort," uses machine learning and computer vision to automatically identify and sort different types of waste materials, improving recycling efficiency. The system demonstrated an impressive 95% accuracy rate during the competition trials.</p>
        
        <p>Team leader Aditya Patel explained that the project was inspired by the waste management challenges faced in urban India. "We wanted to create a solution that could make a real difference in our communities while also showcasing the technical skills we've developed during our time at VK College," he said.</p>
        
        <p>The team received a cash prize of â‚¹2,00,000 and an opportunity to incubate their project with a leading technology company. This achievement highlights the quality of research and innovation happening at our institution.</p>
        
        <p>Dr. Mehta, Dean of Engineering, attributes this success to the college's emphasis on practical, project-based learning. "We encourage our students to apply their theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems. This victory is a testament to their hard work and creativity."</p>
        
        <p>The winning team members include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aditya Patel (Team Leader)</li>

      title: 'Tips for Maintaining Mental Health During Exam Season',
      excerpt: 'Our college counselor shares practical strategies to help students manage stress and maintain wellbeing during examination periods.',
      content: `
        <p>As exam season approaches, many students experience increased stress and anxiety. Taking care of your mental health is just as important as studying for your exams. Here are some practical strategies to help you maintain balance during this challenging time.</p>
        
        <h3>Effective Study Techniques</h3>
        <p>Rather than cramming, try distributed practice - spreading your study sessions over time. Research shows this leads to better retention than marathon study sessions. Also, test yourself regularly instead of just reviewing notes. Active recall strengthens memory and identifies gaps in your understanding.</p>
        
        <h3>Time Management</h3>
        <p>Create a realistic study schedule that includes breaks. The Pomodoro Technique - studying for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break - works well for many students. Don't forget to schedule time for sleep, meals, and some physical activity.</p>
        
        <h3>Physical Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>Your physical and mental health are closely connected. Try to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get 7-8 hours of sleep each night</li>
          <li>Eat nutritious meals rather than relying on caffeine and sugar</li>
          <li>Include some form of physical activity daily, even if it's just a 15-minute walk</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Stress Management</h3>
        <p>When you feel overwhelmed, try deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation. Mindfulness meditation can also help calm your mind - even 5 minutes can make a difference.</p>
        
        <h3>Seek Support</h3>
        <p>Remember that you don't have to face exam stress alone. Connect with classmates for study groups, talk to friends and family about how you're feeling, or visit the college counseling center. Sometimes just voicing your concerns can provide relief.</p>
        
        <p>Remember that your worth is not determined by your exam results. Do your best, but also be kind to yourself during this challenging period.</p>

      title: 'Alumni Spotlight: From College Project to Successful Startup',
      excerpt: 'How a final year project at VK College evolved into a thriving edutech startup that\'s changing how students learn programming.',
      content: `
        <p>Five years ago, Vikram Malhotra was a final-year computer science student working on a project to make programming more accessible to beginners. Today, his company CodeCraft has over 500,000 users and recently secured â‚¹8 crore in Series A funding.</p>
        
        <p>"It all started in the college lab," says Vikram. "We were trying to solve a problem we faced ourselves - how to visualize programming concepts in a way that makes them easier to grasp."</p>
        
        <p>The project, initially called "CodeVis," used interactive visualizations to illustrate programming concepts like data structures and algorithms. Vikram's professor, Dr. Rajesh Kumar, recognized its potential and encouraged him to develop it further.</p>
        
        <p>After graduation, Vikram teamed up with two classmates to transform the project into a web platform. They spent a year refining the product while participating in the college's incubation program, which provided mentorship and initial funding.</p>
        
        <p>The platform gained traction among computer science students and self-taught programmers, growing primarily through word of mouth. Today, CodeCraft offers courses in multiple programming languages and has users from over 50 countries.</p>
        
        <p>Vikram attributes much of his success to the foundation he received at VK College. "The emphasis on practical projects and the encouragement to think creatively really prepared me for entrepreneurship," he reflects.</p>
        
        <p>His advice to current students? "Find problems that genuinely interest you, and don't be afraid to pursue your ideas beyond the classroom. The project that seems like just an assignment today could be the beginning of something much bigger."</p>
